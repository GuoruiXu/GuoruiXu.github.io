## Some Notes About Mathematics


## Undergraduate Research and Summer School
> + **(2021 Summer) 2021 BICMR Summer School on Differential Geometry:** Here is the homepage: [2021 BICMR DG Summer school](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/cn/content/show/17-2464.html). 
>> My grades: (1) Complex Geometry: 100/100;
>> 
>> (2) Riemannian Geometry: 90/100.

> + **(2020.12 – 2021.11) Undergraduate Research about Basic Algebraic Geometry:** (advisor: Yin Hongbo) We learned some basic scheme theory and cohomology and some basic complex geommetry. [Summary](/AGRESKC.pdf).

## Some Seminars in Shandong University (Undergraduate)
> + **(2022 Spring) Seminar of Symplectic Geometry** We discuss the second chapters of D. Macduff and D. Salamon's Introduction to Symplectic Topology and the Chapter 1-7 in Ana Cannas da Silva's [book](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~acannas/Papers/lsg.pdf). One of my lecture: [Moser's trick](/2022Symp1.pdf).

> + **(2021 Autumn) Seminar of Algebraic Topology** We discuss the first two chapters of R. Nott and L. W. Tu's Differential Froms in Algebraic Topology. I discussed the section 5 and the half of section 11. Here is my lectures:
>> My Lectures: (1) [Section 5](/2021ATSe1.pdf);
>>
>> (2) [Section 11](/2021ATSe2.pdf).

> + **(2020 Autumn) Seminar of Homological Algebra** We discuss the chapter 5-8 of J.J. Rotman's An Introduction to Homological Algebra. I discuss the section 6.1. Here is my lecture notes: [Section6.1](/2020HASe.pdf).
